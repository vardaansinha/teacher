# Setting up Github Pages

# Overview 

You will want to create a Github Pages blog for this class. This is a place where you can code, complete the hacks and submit them through a review ticket, and record what you have learned. 
<br>

# Setup

1. Fork the [student repository](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student) by clicking on "Fork". 
    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fork.jpg)

    This will direct you to a page where you can give a name and description for your repository. Keep "Copy the main branch only" checked and then click on "Create fork". 

2. Once your repository is created, click on the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS link provided.

3. In WSL, go to your vscode directory (`cd ~/vscode`). Then clone the repository with `git clone <link copied from step 3>`.

4. Open your repository in VS Code with `code <repository name>`. Now you can start code, code, coding!

<br>

# Running Github Pages locally

To see your blog update locally as you edit, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal in VS Code with <code>Ctrl + `</code>

2. Type `bundle install`

3. Type `make`. Then, go to the link provided in the output:
    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/output.jpg)

Now, whenever the blog is edited in VS Code, the local website will show the changes upon refresh.

# Give Github Pages a custom domain

# Overview

AWS Route 53 is a DNS service that provides routing to web applications. When you enter a URL in your web browser, the request is sent to a DNS resolver. The resolver finds a Route 53 server that can translate the URL into its corresponding IP address. The Route 53 server sends the information back to the resolver, who then sends it to the browser. The browser is able to access the webpage through the IP address it received.

In addition, you can use Route 53 to create a domain that maps to your Github Pages blog. In the example below, the domain https://lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/ will point to https://lwu1822.github.io/student/.

<br>

# Steps

## AWS

1. Go to AWS Route 53, and click on "Hosted zones". 

2. Click on "Create record". 

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/createRecord.jpg)

3. Create a subdomain in "Record name". Change the "Record type" to CNAME. CNAME creates an alias that maps one domain name to another domain. Finally, in the "Value" section, enter your Github URL in the form of: `<username>.github.io`. **Be sure to omit the link to your repository**. 

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/details.jpg)

4. Click on "Create records". Your record should look something like this:

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/record.jpg)

## Github Pages

1. Create a Github pages repository and click on "Settings".

2. In the sidebar, click on "Pages". Under "Build and deployment", ensure that the Github Pages is being built from the main branch. If you forked nighthawkcoders/student, you might need to specify that before you can move on to Step 3.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/deploy.jpg)

3. Enter the domain you configured in Hosted zones.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customDomain.jpg)

    Github pages will run a DNS check. Once the check is successful, access your Github pages with your new domain name (ex: lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com). The domain should redirect to your Github Pages blog.

    **Troubleshooting**: If the check is unsuccessful, check to see that you did the "AWS" steps properly. Also check to see if you spelled the domain correctly in Github Pages. If that does not work, delete the record in AWS and create it again. (It took me multiple times to get it to work, even though I typed the correct domain name. So if you encounter this error, you may have to be patient.)

4. Click "Enforce HTTPS" so that the domain will be accessed over HTTPS.

## Afterwards

In `_config.yml`, change the line that says `baseurl` to:

```
baseurl: ""
```

This ensures that Github Pages is formatted correctly. This is because originally, the Github Pages site was under the subdirectory `student` (ex: lwu1822.github.io/**student**). After configuring a domain/subdomain,  the baseurl would be "" since the URL would look like https://lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/ (no subdirectory).

## Troubleshooting

### Accessing the custom domain name returns a default Nginx page
